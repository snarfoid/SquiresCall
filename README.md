# SquiresCall Metadata 
Meta-data tool for building Squire's Call app. 

I started writing an interactive story adventure for iOS in Swift. There's quite a bit more to it than the simple branching tree of story possibilities. Certain story options have prerequisites, and various interactions with non-player characters have a variable outcome based on a number of factors, and given the planned scope of the story, there's no way I will be able to consistently manually manage metadata across all those story points.  Hence, a tool to help me do it.  

I chose a few libraries I haven't used before just to see some new things. This is very much a work in progress, and isn't even really functional at this point. It will become so as time permits, but time is short these days.
